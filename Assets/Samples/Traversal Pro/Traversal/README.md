# Traversal Pro

## Description
Traversal Pro is a physics based character controller where the character is represented as an upright capsule collider with a dynamic rigidbody. It applies forces to the rigidbody to move the character but does not snap or teleport the character to the ground each frame. This allows other game systems to freely add forces to the character. Features in Traversal Pro are implemented as individual components so if you donâ€™t need a particular feature, then you can just remove that component. 

## Getting Started
Right click in the Hierarchy window and select Traversal Pro / First Person Player or Third Person Player to create a player. You can control the character with mouse and keyboard or with a gamepad.

## Support
The best way to get support is to join the [Traversal Pro Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Rkk5UzAXTr). I'd also love to just see what you're using it for and get feedback and suggestions for its development.

## Package Status
As of early 2025 I am actively developing Traversal Pro.
